## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added
- `EcapaTdnnExtractor` — ONNX-based ECAPA-TDNN speaker embedding extractor with built-in log-mel filterbank preprocessing (`src/ecapa.rs`, `src/features.rs`).
- `compute_fbank` — pure-Rust 80-bin log-mel filterbank extraction (pre-emphasis, Hamming window, FFT via `realfft`, mel-filterbank, log compression).
- Real-audio benchmark suite (`benches/diarization.rs`) using Criterion: offline diarization latency and ECAPA fbank throughput on synthetic multi-speaker waveforms.
- Hoare triple doc comments on all public API functions per `cargo-kimi` guidelines.
- `// SAFETY` annotations for every `unsafe` block and `unsafe extern "C" fn` in `ffi.rs`.

### Changed
- Bumped `ndarray` to `0.17` for compatibility with `ort` 2.0.0-rc.12.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-05-05

### Added
- Initial release of `polyvoice`.
- `EmbeddingExtractor` trait with `DummyExtractor` (tests) and `OnnxEmbeddingExtractor` (ONNX Runtime, pooled sessions).
- `SpeakerCluster` with online incremental centroid updates and cosine-similarity threshold.
- `OnlineDiarizer` for real-time streaming with sliding windows.
- `OfflineDiarizer` for file-based diarization with segment merging and gap filling.
- `VoiceActivityDetector` trait with `EnergyVad` reference implementation.
- Overlap detection (`detect_overlaps`) from fine-grained segment lists.
- Word-level speaker alignment (`OnlineDiarizer::align_words`).
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests.
